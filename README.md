## Prerequisites

Please install or have installed the following:

- [nodejs and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
## Installation

1. [Install Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html), if you haven't already. Here is a simple way to install brownie.

```bash
pip install eth-brownie
```

2. [Install ganache-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache-cli)

```bash
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

1. Set your `WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID`, and `PRIVATE_KEY` [environment variables](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html). You can get this by getting a free trial of [Infura](https://infura.io/). At the moment, it does need to be infura. You can find your `PRIVATE_KEY` from your ethereum wallet like [metamask](https://metamask.io/). 

Otherwise, you can build, test, and deploy on your local environment.
